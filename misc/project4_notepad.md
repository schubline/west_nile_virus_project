Perhaps we should train three models on three different sets of features and then ensemble them somehow?
This will require some method for ad hoc ensemble.  Perhaps one works on weather, one works on spraying, one works on trap data?

Work on each classifier in parallel until it is determined that a classifier is complete, or should be abandoned or sgoudl be combined with another classifier, etc., then re-allocate staff.


### pseudopseudocode

*Put all data into a dataframe or dataframes*
 * Clean it, join it, etc.  
 * Make sure this is ultimately embodied in a function, so we can conveniently put the test data through the same pipeline
 * import libraries
  
*EDA* 
 * Get basic stats, whatever you like  
 * Build a baseline model and run it

*Build trap classifier*  
 * Uses train.csv  
 * Should have a method to give equivalent of 'predict_proba' on any observation in test set  
 * idealy, this will be a single function  

*Build weather classifier*
 * Uses weather.csv
 * Should have a method to give equivalent of 'predict_proba' on  any observation in test set
 * idealy, this will be a single function

*Build spray classifier* 
 * Uses spray.csv  
 * Should have a method to give equivalent of 'predict_proba' on  any observation in test set  
 * idealy, this will be a single function  

*Build the ensemble classifier*
 * Somehow synthesize the predictions  
 * ideally, this will be a single function  

*Posprocessing*
 * Output predictions for test data into CSV  


### Style Guide

 * DF Column names in CamelCase
 * variable names in snake_case
 * function names in snake_case
 * Docstrings for all functions unless they're basically trivial
 * Classifiers should not refer to global variables
