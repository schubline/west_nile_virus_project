## The Situation: West Nile Virus History
 - West Mile Virus (WNV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic arbovirus
 - Found in temperate and tropical regions of the world
 - First identified in the West Nile Sub region in the East African Nation of Uganda in 1937
 - Before mid 1990s, WNV disease was occurred only sporadically and was considered a minor risk to humans
 - Algeria - 1994: Cases of WNV cause encephalitis
 - Romania 1996: High number of cases with neuroinvasive disease
 - WNV has now spread globally, with the first recorded case in the Western Hemisphere in NYC in 1999
 - Over the following 5 years, the virus spread across US, up into Canada, and down into Latin America and Caribbean
 - In 2012, WNV killed 286 people in the US

## Transmission:
 - Mosquitoes are prime vector
 - Birds are the most commonly infected animal and are the prime reservoir host
 - WNV also infects various mammal species, including humans, and has been identified in reptilian species, including alligators, crocodiles and amphibians
 - Not all animal species are susceptible to WNV infection, including humans, develop sufficient viral levels to transmit the disease to uninfected mosquitoes, and are thus not considered major factors in WNV transmission
 - Main cycle is between mosquitoes and the birds


## Infections
 - 80% of WNV infections in humans are subclinical, which cause no symptoms
 - In cases where symptoms do occur, those can include:m
     - Fever
     - Headaches
     - Fatigue
     - Muscle pain or aches
     - Malaise
     - Nausea
     - Vomit
- Less than 1% of cases are severe and result in neurological disease when the central nervous system is affected
    - WN encephalitis
    - WN meningitis
    - WN meningeoncephalitis
    - WN poliomyelitis

## Prevention
- Complication: No vaccine against WNV exist to date
- Best methods to reduce rates of WNV infection is mosquito control by municipalities to reduce breeding populations in private, public and commercial areas
- Goal of algorithm: Predict where outbreaks are likely to occur to avoid indiscriminately spraying.  

## Kaggle Data
- Traps (lat, long, num mosquitoes...)
- Weather (temp, humidity, windspeed, precipitation...)
- Spray (Location, Date-Time)
- WNV (0/1)
- Observations: High concentration near vegetation/parks, wind blows them a bit further from hotspot
