## Problem
Where, when, and under what conditions should the City of Chicago use pesticides most effectively to prevent outbreaks of West Nile Virus?  

## Data Sources
Gather data  
What data might be available that can predict the presence of West Nile infected mosquitos?  
Build a model for the probability that the disease will be present  
Assess the cost of spraying versus benefit for different model thresholds  

## EDA

## Models

**Plan: Make three models and using the models' predictions and probabilities make one prediction from them. The three models each use different data.**
