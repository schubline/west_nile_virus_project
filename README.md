### Steps
Gather data  
What data might be available that can predict the presence of West Nile infected mosquitos?  
Build a model for the probability that the disease will be present  
Assess the cost of spraying versus benefit for different model thresholds  

## Data Sources
Trap location data for 2007-2014. with odd-numbered years labeled with number of mosquitos and West Nile cases.
Weather data for relevant years.
Spray data for 2011 and 2013.
